| Azure AD Integration | Waiting for tenant permissions | Medium | 2025-04-01 |
| Private Link setup | Dependency on network admin approval | High | 2025-04-02 |

## Next Sprint

### Compute Resources
- [ ] Virtual Machine module
- [ ] Scale Set configuration
- [ ] Managed Identity integration
- [ ] Terragrunt configuration for compute resources

### Monitoring
- [ ] Log Analytics Workspace
- [ ] Diagnostic settings
- [ ] Alert configuration

## Notes and Issues Encountered

### Performance Considerations
- Consider using Azure VWAN for multi-region connectivity
- Evaluate Premium Storage for production workloads
- Terragrunt cache performance should be monitored

### Security Findings
- NSG rules should be tightened for production
- Key rotation should be implemented for service principals
- Ensure no credentials are stored in Terragrunt configurations
