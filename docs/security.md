# Security Practices & Guidelines

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for our Azure infrastructure deployment.

## Security Principles

Our security approach is based on the following core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls throughout the infrastructure
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum access necessary for a task
3. **Secure by Default**: All systems configured securely from initial deployment
4. **Zero Trust**: Verify explicitly, use least privileged access, assume breach
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing vigilance and real-time threat detection

## Access Control

### Azure RBAC

Role-Based Access Control is implemented at all levels:

| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Owner | Full access | Emergency only |
| Contributor | Can manage resources, but not grant access | DevOps team |
| Reader | Can view resources, but not make changes | Monitoring team |
| Custom Roles | Specific permissions for specific resources | Service accounts |

### Key Management

1. **Key Vault**: All secrets, certificates, and keys stored in Azure Key Vault
2. **Rotation Policy**: Keys rotated every 90 days
3. **Access Policy**: Limited to specific identities and specific operations
4. **Audit Logging**: All access attempts logged and monitored

## Network Security

### Virtual Network Isolation

1. **Network Segmentation**:
   - Public-facing resources in perimeter subnets
   - Application tier in isolated subnets
   - Data tier in restricted subnets

2. **Network Security Groups**:
   - Default deny all inbound traffic
   - Explicit allow rules for required traffic
   - Service tags used where possible
   - Application Security Groups for micro-segmentation

3. **Private Endpoints**:
   - Used for all Azure PaaS services
   - Traffic stays on Microsoft backbone network
   - No public IP exposure

### Azure Firewall

1. **Centralized Policy Enforcement**:
   - Inbound protection for public-facing services
   - Outbound protection for internet access
   - East-west traffic filtering between subnets

2. **Threat Intelligence**:
   - Integration with Microsoft Threat Intelligence
   - Block traffic to/from known malicious IPs
   - Alert on suspicious patterns

## Data Protection

### Encryption

1. **Encryption in Transit**:
   - TLS 1.2+ for all communications
   - Service endpoints for Azure services
   - Private Link for sensitive services

2. **Encryption at Rest**:
   - All storage accounts encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys
   - Sensitive data encrypted with customer-managed keys in Key Vault
   - Databases configured with Transparent Data Encryption

3. **Key Management**:
   - Customer-managed keys stored in Key Vault
   - Key Vault audited and backed up
   - RBAC controls on key operations

### Data Lifecycle

1. **Classification**:
   - Data classified according to sensitivity
   - Tags applied to resources with sensitive data

2. **Retention**:
   - Defined retention periods for all data types
   - Automated deletion of data past retention period

3. **Backup**:
   - Regular backups of all critical data
   - Backup encryption with separate keys
   - Regular recovery testing

## Identity & Authentication

### Azure Active Directory

1. **Centralized Identity Management**:
   - All users and service principals in Azure AD
   - No local accounts on any resources

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**:
   - Required for all human accounts
   - Conditional Access policies based on risk

3. **Managed Identities**:
   - Used for all service-to-service authentication
   - No stored credentials or connection strings

## Monitoring & Detection

### Logging

1. **Centralized Logging**:
   - All logs sent to Log Analytics Workspace
   - Minimum 90-day retention period
   - Key logs archived for long-term storage

2. **Diagnostic Settings**:
   - Enabled for all resources
   - Control plane and data plane operations logged
   - Resource-specific logs configured

### Alert Rules

1. **Security Alerts**:
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Privilege escalation
   - Resource modification outside change windows
   - Unusual access patterns

2. **Operational Alerts**:
   - Service health issues
   - Performance thresholds
   - Capacity warnings

## Compliance Controls

### Azure Policy

1. **Compliance Policies**:
   - Enforce encryption settings
   - Require secure TLS versions
   - Restrict public network access
   - Ensure proper tagging

2. **Remediation**:
   - Automatic remediation where possible
   - Notification for manual remediation needs

### Security Assessments

1. **Regular Assessments**:
   - Weekly vulnerability scans
   - Monthly security posture review
   - Quarterly penetration tests

2. **Reporting**:
   - Security posture dashboard
   - Compliance status tracking
   - Remediation progress monitoring

## Incident Response

### Process

1. **Detection**: Alert triggers or manual observation
2. **Analysis**: Assess impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat source
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update procedures based on findings

### Response Team

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Incident Commander | Coordinate overall response |
| Security Analyst | Investigate technical details |
| System Administrator | Implement containment/recovery actions |
| Communications Lead | Manage stakeholder communications |

## Secure Development

### Infrastructure as Code

1. **Code Review**:
   - All infrastructure changes reviewed by security team
   - Automated scanning for security best practices

2. **Testing**:
   - Security tests included in deployment pipeline
   - Regular validation of deployed configurations

3. **Secrets Management**:
   - No secrets in code repositories
   - References to Key Vault or environment variables only
